# SolShield – Introduction

**SolShield ($SHIELD)** is a planned decentralized privacy layer for the Solana blockchain.

## Problem Statement
Solana is one of the fastest and most cost-effective blockchains, but all transactions are fully transparent and traceable by default.  
For many users — traders, DeFi participants, NFT collectors, and privacy-conscious individuals — this lack of transaction privacy is a significant limitation.

## Vision
SolShield aims to provide an accessible, user-friendly way to enhance transaction privacy on Solana without sacrificing speed or cost.

## Core Utility of $SHIELD Token
- **Payment for privacy services**: Users pay a small fee in $SHIELD to use the mixing protocol.
- **Discount tiers**: Holding $SHIELD reduces mixing fees.
- **Staking & Real Yield**: A large portion of collected fees is distributed to $SHIELD stakers as sustainable rewards.

**Status (January 2026)**:  
The project is in the **early conceptual and prototyping phase**.  
No on-chain contracts or functional mixer exist yet. Current repository contains only design, mock logic, and frontend prototype.
